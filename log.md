This week we briefly discussed about the form the [satisfaction
functionality](https://github.com/OrfeasLitos/UC-Trust/blob/master/what_is_trust/algorithms/satfunc.tex)
is taking. More specifically, Dr. Kiayias saw two things: first, that the functionality
does not in any way inform the player with the minimum price (Bob) about him facilitating
the satisfaction of a desire of another player who expressed this desire (Alice) and
second, that the functionality attempts to maximize the overall utility even if that means
that specific players may see their utilities slightly reduced. Thus Dr. Kiayias proposed
that we should aim for some form of this functionality that will allow us to use both a
normal financial ledger and a [Trust is
Risk](https://github.com/OrfeasLitos/TrustIsRisk/blob/master/fc17.pdf)-like ledger as its
realisations and eventually argue formally that the latter realisation offers more
attractive properties, financially speaking.

Note: this is the first log entry, but not the first meeting. Aggelos Kiayias has been my
supervisor since May 2017 and we have had several meetings since.
